# Lesson 1. Important terms

### What is the Machine Learning

Machine Learning is making the computer learn from studying data and statistics.

Machine Learning is a step into the direction of artificial intelligence (AI).

Machine Learning is a program that analyses data and learns to predict the outcome.

### Data Set

In the mind of a computer, a data set is any collection of data. It can be anything from an array to a complete database.

Example of an array:

```Python
[99,86,87,88,111,86,103,87,94,78,77,85,86]
```

### Data types

To analyze data, it is important to know what type of data we are dealing with.

We can split the data types into three main categories:

- Numerical
- Categorical
- Ordinal

<b>Numerical</b> data are numbers, and can be split into two numerical categories:

Discrete Data

- numbers that are limited to integers. Example: The number of cars passing by.
  Continuous Data
- numbers that are of infinite value. Example: The price of an item, or the size of an item

<b>Categorical</b> data are values that cannot be measured up against each other. Example: a color value, or any yes/no values.

<b>Ordinal</b> data are like categorical data, but can be measured up against each other. Example: school grades where A is better than B and so on.

By knowing the data type of your data source, you will be able to know what technique to use when analyzing them.
